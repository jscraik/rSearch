# Validation and checks

## Focused validation loop
- Run focused checks immediately after edits.
- Run broader repository checks before final handoff.
- Record exact command output for failed checks.

## Safety checks
- Verify required binaries before command-heavy tasks.
- Verify target paths exist before editing.
